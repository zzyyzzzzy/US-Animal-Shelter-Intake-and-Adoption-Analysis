## Abstract
The overpopulation of homeless animals continually grows in the United States. Millions of dogs and cats entered animal shelters are euthanized every year because of overcrowding. According to the law, once an animal enters a shelter, the owner has three to ten days to reclaim the animal before being placed for adoption, sold, or euthanized. Animal shelters are faced with challenges due to limited resources in space, staffing, and facilities. Statistics and literature focus on reasoning and adoption prediction; however, there is little discussion of the actionable implementation to resolve the crowdedness problem. This paper analyzes a series of national dogs and cats data in 2020 to discover factors and trends linked to overcrowding and adoption subjectively and geographically. Through the explorative visualizations, we discovered that the total number of intakes in an animal organization does not necessarily reflect the crowdedness because of the uneven resource distribution among states and organizations. Our study also shows an increasing seasonal trend of the total intakes towards December. Among the adopted dogs and cats, we discover that age, breed, and coat are the top three features affecting the adoption rate. Further, there is a correlation between the total number of licensed breeders and total intakes; however, we do not have enough evidence to conclude such phenomenon as causation, especially when online dog shipping services become prevalent. We aim to provide actionable insights to help animal shelters reduce the crowdedness by (a) transporting animals to the optimal location and (b) increasing their adoption rate.
